REPK (Restriction Endonuclease Picker) finds sets of 4 commercially available restriction endonucleases which together uniquely differentiate user-designated sequence groups from a user-supplied FASTA format sequence file. The user-defined sequences groups allow the user to determine particular groups (e.g. taxonomic) of sequences to be differentiated by the program. REPK is thus particularly useful in the case where a microbial community has been characterized by clone library analysis, as the actual sequences can be input into the program. If you have a database of known sequences from an environment, this program could be useful to pick some enzymes that uniquely discriminate the different groups in your database.
